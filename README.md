# Personal STT Benchmarking

## Purpose Statement

This project contains a couple of vocal samples I used in order to evaluate the efficacy of different speech to text models. 

I used a large language model in order to generate synthetic data which was attempted to be representative of the type of data that might be captured by users in the course of using various speech to text tools. 

It took a few iterations at prompting and Assistant configuration in order to get something like representative data. I seem to have most success by using the "fly on the wall" metaphor - telling the model that its purpose was to generate simulated transcripts as if it were a fly on the wall transcribing voice commands and speech a user was dictating into voice to text tools.

Lest the couple of short voice samples and transcripts serve as useful material for anyone else evaluating different STTs ..... I'm happy to provide my voice as a data point!
