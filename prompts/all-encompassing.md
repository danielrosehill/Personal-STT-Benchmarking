# Prompt for generating synthetic reading material for ground truth file

Your task is to generate a text that would take approximately five minutes to dictate. 

The text should simulate prompts provided to a large language model as they would be captures during dictation (Although the generated text shouldn't include filler words like "ehm", it should read as if it were captured from colloquial speech without any editing. )

In addition to the simulated prompts include the following elements:

- Simulated voice commands entering appointments in a calendar system. 
- Simulated voice commands That would be used on a digital assistant platform. 
- Simulated short notes that a user might enter into a notepad with speech to text features. These can be about literally any subject, but the simulation should cover both personal and professional use cases. 
 
 Here is how you should format and provide the transcript:

 - The title should be synthetic reading material for ground truth file generation. 
 - Before the generated text write in capital letters start of transcript. 
 - After the end of the synthetic generated text, write end of transcript and capital letters. 

Provide the entire transcripts within a markdown code fence. 

If you need to do so, chunk the output. But choose logical divisions to enable the transcript to be reconstructed.
