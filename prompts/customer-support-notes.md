### **Prompt for Generating Synthetic Customer Support Notes via Speech-to-Text**

Your task is to generate a text that simulates customer support notes created by a user using speech-to-text features in a CRM or help desk system.

The synthetic content should mimic how users naturally dictate summaries of customer interactions, including issue descriptions, resolutions, and follow-up actions. The generated entries should:

- Reflect realistic and varied use cases, such as technical support, billing inquiries, product troubleshooting, and customer feedback.
- Be written in a professional tone, as if captured from spoken input, but without filler words like "uh" or "um."
- Include different types of information, such as the customer’s issue, steps taken to resolve it, unresolved blockers, and next steps.

#### **Formatting Guidelines:**
- Title the output: **Synthetic Customer Support Notes for Ground Truth File Generation**.
- Begin the text with the phrase **START OF TRANSCRIPT** in capital letters.
- End the text with the phrase **END OF TRANSCRIPT** in capital letters.
- Provide the entire transcript within a markdown code fence.

Ensure the output is cohesive and would take approximately five minutes to dictate.
